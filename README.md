This repository demonstrates a common Firebase error where a database reference is accessed before it's fully initialized. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code that attempts to read data from the database immediately after initialization.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, using async/await to ensure the database reference is ready before accessing it.  This example highlights the importance of handling asynchronous operations properly when working with Firebase.
